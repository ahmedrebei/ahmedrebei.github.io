Variational inference approaches are gaining more and more success and are applied in various data mining applications. In this work, we present a variational learning framework for the Shifted Scaled Dirichlet finite mixture model. Furthermore, we introduce component splitting based on Entropy approximation to estimate the number of components in our model along with the parameters of the distribution. We test the performance of this model on two real-life datasets, both related to human activity recognition.
